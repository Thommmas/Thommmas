Hello, I'm Thomas, a Computer Science student at the <strong><a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_School_of_Engineering ... attributes-list>Ecole polytechnique de Louvain</a></strong> (EPL) in <strong>Belgium</strong>. With a background in engineering and astrophysics :telescope:, I am driven by my curiosity for both the intricacies of technology and the vast wonders of space :milky_way:. My GitHub is a reflection of my diverse interests, showcasing projects in computer science, game design, and engineering. I'm constantly exploring innovative ways to blend my knowledge of programming with my love for creating immersive experiences. Join me on my journey ! :satellite:
